#####fizzbuzz.rb 
FizzBuzz for Ruby (loop, conditional, stdout, mod)

####triangle-checker.rb 
Computes probability that a random division of a line into three components will result in a triangle. Without loss of generality, assume the line is of unit length. Test for the triangle equality on all three sides. (function, logical operator, loop, random number, conditional, increment, cast using to_f)
